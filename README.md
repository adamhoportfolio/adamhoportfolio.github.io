**To-Do for Next Commit**
3/21/25
- IMPORTANT!!! manually added a link to powerbi dashboard in body text. don't forget to keep that change when importing next webflow update


3/1/25
- Still have flashbang on blog posts
- Post export changes:
-   must remove webflow badges from images and change css to use .w-webflow-badge {
    display: none !important;
} for anything involving the badge
- may have to reload without cache (ctrl shift r) to remove badge on browser
- next time, if there is one, update files using github desktop not upload on browser as it has a lower capacity
- exflow now has limits on num pages to export, and paid tiers. this portfolio site may not be sustainable after this. may have to transition to another site or abandon portfolio altogether hopefully due to scoring next job

2/10/25
- Blog Posts pages default to white background before dark animation fades in
- Change About section pfp
- Add more contact/links at bottom
- Either add instructions to Overleaf to view without code, or figure out another solution to have users view without code
- Optional: Add Work Experience section
- Optional: Add colorful elements in background
- Reorder such that PokeAPI isn't at forefront; alternatively figure out way to date projects truly, but sort them manually
